TODO
- setting of custom published_at needed
  (need to possibly find better way of combining
   this tool and scheduled?)
- set up scheduled status
- set up types ?

- Need to write logic to tie tags to posts / posts to tags
- If I decide to implement categories,
  those need to be implemented just like tags
  (the only exception being that only one
   category is allowed per post)

Note to self:
 Tags / Categories w no Posts should never be shown.

- Need to have local fallback for SimpleMDE to get its icons.
- Should use CDNs for content where available.
- Want to have local fallback for all content. (?)
