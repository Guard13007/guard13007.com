TODO
- setting of custom published_at needed
  (need to possibly find better way of combining
   this tool and scheduled?)
- set up scheduled status
- set up types ?

- Need to write logic to tie tags to posts / posts to tags
- If I decide to implement categories,
  those need to be implemented just like tags
  (the only exception being that only one
   category is allowed per post)

Note to self:
 Tags / Categories w no Posts should never be shown.

- Need to have local fallback for SimpleMDE to get its icons.
- Should use CDNs for content where available.
- Want to have local fallback for all content. (?)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- githook should save results of a request into database
  so you can view them on-site
- f needs a toggle for scraping
- f needs a function that can be run in the console to find missing
  images (use registry to save console functions into table?)
- delete secret.moon.example once I have written scripts to automate install process
- the nginx-proxy I am using w f is better than the one my main site is using!
