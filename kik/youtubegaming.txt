Rules for the #youtubegaming Kik chat:

This chat is for YouTube and gaming. Other topics should
go elsewhere.

1. Do not insult other users or their opinions.
2. No "copy and paste this" type posts.
3. Advertising your channel or videos is fine.
   However, you will be warned if you excessively advertise.
   Do not advertise at participants outside of this chat.
4. No "you've been [...]" type messages.
   Examples: https://imgur.com/a/G61SA
5. No explicit photos.

I can and will add rules as needed. I will notify the chat
when I do.

Please let me know (Guard13007) if you have any questions or
recommendations for these rules.
