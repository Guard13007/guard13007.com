Reasons I'm leaving Kik:

1. I don't have time. Between managing my YouTube channel, being a full-time student, my job, and programming, I no longer have the time or space in my mind to manage more than one chat program.
2. I primarily managed two YouTube-related chats that were mostly garbage. I'm sick of wasting my time trying to improve the quality of conversation while almost no one else seems to care.
3. I'm sick of daily or weekly spam. No other platform has this much unfiltered garbage.
4. The developers of the platform seem disinterested in anything useful or interesting happening on their platform.

And that's about it. I will still be available where listed at http://guard13007.com/chat
