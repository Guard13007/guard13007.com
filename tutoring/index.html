        <h1>Computer Science Tutoring</h1>

        <p>My name is Paul Liverman, I tutor Computer Science (CS) at San Bernardino Valley College.</p>

        <p>The hours below are for tutoring in the Student Success Center in the Physical Science building (PS-134). It's located at the end of the hallway on the ground floor. If you need a map to find the building, <a href="https://www.valleycollege.edu/about-sbvc/maps-directions-parking">click here</a>.</p>

        <p>You can find more information about the Student Success Center <a href="https://www.valleycollege.edu/student-services/tutoring-academic-support/student-success-center">here</a> and information about other tutoring and academic support servies at SBVC <a href="https://www.valleycollege.edu/student-services/tutoring-academic-support">here</a>.</p>

        <!----/><p><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: I will not be available on <b>March 30<sup>th</sup></b> due to yet another dentist appointment.</p><!---->

        <p><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: Unfortunately, my hours have been cut. This is partially due to budget problems, and partially due to a lack of students coming in for tutoring.</p>
